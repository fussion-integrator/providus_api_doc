- Bearer Token:Token: your_access_token
- OAuth 2.0:Configure OAuth settings as provided.

Basic Auth:

- Username: your_username
- Password: your_password

`your_username``your_password`Bearer Token:

- Token: your_access_token

`your_access_token`OAuth 2.0:

- Configure OAuth settings as provided.

Configure OAuth settings as provided.

### 6. Headers and Body

- Navigate to the "Headers" tab.
- Add any necessary headers for your API:Sample Headers:Content-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer your_access_token
- Switch to the "Body" tab to input request parameters or payload if applicable.Choose the appropriate data format (e.g., JSON, form-data).Input request parameters or payload.Sample JSON Body:Copy{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}

Navigate to the "Headers" tab.

Add any necessary headers for your API:

- Sample Headers:Content-Type: application/jsonAuthorization: Bearer your_access_token

Sample Headers:

- Content-Type: application/json
- Authorization: Bearer your_access_token

`Content-Type: application/json``Authorization: Bearer your_access_token`Switch to the "Body" tab to input request parameters or payload if applicable.

- Choose the appropriate data format (e.g., JSON, form-data).
- Input request parameters or payload.
- Sample JSON Body:Copy{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}

Choose the appropriate data format (e.g., JSON, form-data).

Input request parameters or payload.

Sample JSON Body:

```
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

### 7. Pre-request Scripts

Utilize pre-request scripts for dynamic data generation or environment setup:

- Navigate to the "Pre-request Scripts" tab.
- Write scripts in JavaScript to manipulate variables or set up dynamic data.

Navigate to the "Pre-request Scripts" tab.

Write scripts in JavaScript to manipulate variables or set up dynamic data.

### 8. Tests

Write tests to validate the API response:

- Navigate to the "Tests" tab.
- Write JavaScript tests to verify status codes, response body, or any custom validation.

Navigate to the "Tests" tab.

Write JavaScript tests to verify status codes, response body, or any custom validation.

### 9. Environments
